### Layer 4 (Transport)
- Segments and reassembles data for communications between **end-host**
- Breaks large pieces of data into smaller segments which can be more easily sent over the network and are less likely to cause transmission problems if errors occur
- Provide **host-to-host** communication
### Layer 3 (Network)
- Provides connectivity between end hosts on different networks (ie. outside of the LAN)
- Provides logical addressing (IP address)
- Provides path selection between source and destination
- Routers operate at Layer 3
### Layer 2 (Data Link)
- Provides **node-to-node** connectivity and data transfer (for example, PC to switch, switch to router, router to router)
- Defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium (for example, copper UTP cables)
- Detects and (possibly) corrects Physical Layer errors
- Uses Layer 2 addressing, separate from Layer 3 addresssing (MAC?)
- Switches operate at Layer 2
### Layer 1 (Physical Layer)
- Defines physical characteristics of the medium used to transfer data between devices
- For example, voltage levels, maximun transmission distances, physical connectors, cable specifications, etc.
- Digital bits are converted into electrical (for wired connections) or radio (for wireless connections) signals
